# Citrix Virtual Channel SDK for Citrix Receiver for Windows


The Citrix Virtual Channel Software Development Kit (SDK) provides
support for writing server-side applications and client-side drivers for
additional virtual channels using the ICA protocol. The server-side
virtual channel applications are on XenApp or XenDesktop servers. This
version of the SDK provides support for writing new virtual channels for
Receiver for Windows. If you want to write virtual drivers for other
client platforms, contact Citrix.

The Virtual Channel SDK provides:

* The Citrix Virtual Driver Application Programming Interface (VDAPI)
used with the virtual channel functions in the Citrix Server API SDK
(WFAPI SDK) to create new virtual channels. The virtual channel
support provided by VDAPI is designed to make writing your own virtual
channels easier.

* The Windows Monitoring API, which enhances the visual experience and
support for third-party applications integrated with ICA.

* Working source code for several virtual channel sample programs that
demonstrate programming techniques.

* The Virtual Channel SDK requires the WFAPI SDK to write the server
side of the virtual channel.
