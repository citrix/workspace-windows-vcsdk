# Citrix Virtual Channel SDK for Citrix Workspace app for Windows

The Citrix Virtual Channel Software Development Kit (SDK) provides support for writing server-side applications and client-side drivers for additional virtual channels using the ICA protocol. The server-side virtual channel applications are on Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops servers. This version of the SDK provides support for writing new virtual channels for Citrix Workspace app for Windows. If you want to write virtual drivers for other client platforms, contact Citrix Technical support.

The Virtual Channel SDK provides:

-  The Citrix Virtual Driver Application Programming Interface (VDAPI) used with the virtual channel functions in the Citrix Server API SDK (WFAPI SDK) to create new virtual channels. The virtual channel support provided by VDAPI is designed to make writing your own virtual channels easier.
-  The Windows Monitoring API, which enhances the visual experience and support for third-party applications integrated with ICA.
-  Working source code for several virtual channel sample programs that demonstrate programming techniques.
-  The Virtual Channel SDK requires the WFAPI SDK to write the server side of the virtual channel.
